# Require an empty newline after an import section (newline-after-import-section)


## Rule Details

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
import bar from 'bar';
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'common/bar';
import foo from 'common/foo';
import bar from 'app/bar';
import foo from 'app/foo';
```

The following patterns are not warnings:

```js
import foo from 'foo';

import bar from 'common/bar';
import foo from 'common/foo';

import bar from 'app/bar';
import foo from 'app/foo';
```

### Options

An array of the sections patterns. Defaults to `["^common/", "^app/"]`.

Any module that doesn't match one of these regexps will be regarded as a vendor.

## When Not To Use It

You may want to disable this rule if you don't work with MaÃ«l.
