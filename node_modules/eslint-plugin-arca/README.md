# eslint-plugin-arca

> *A plugin to make Maël happy.*

I usually have strong preferences about what a pretty code should look like. This repo contains some ESLint rules that help enforce this style.

Note that some people might say that I might be a bit too strict on some things, and they might be right.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-arca`:

```
$ npm install eslint-plugin-arca --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-arca` globally.

## Usage

Add `arca` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "arca"
    ]
}
```


Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "arca/curly": 2,
        "arca/import-align": 2,
        "arca/import-ordering": 2,
        "arca/melted-constructs": 2,
        "arca/newline-after-import-section": 2,
        "arca/no-default-export": 2
    }
}
```

## Supported Rules

* [`arca/curly`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/curly.md) - ensure that curly braces keep the code flow easy to read
* [`arca/import-align`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/import-align.md) - require `from` keywords to be aligned
* [`arca/import-ordering`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/import-ordering.md) - ensure that each import in the file is correctly ordered relative to the others
* [`arca/melted-constructs`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/melted-constructs.md) - enforce the use of melted constructs when possible
* [`arca/newline-after-import-section`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/newline-after-var.md) - require an empty newline after an import section
* [`arca/no-default-export`](https://github.com/arcanis/eslint-plugin-arca/blob/master/docs/rules/no-default-export.md) - disallow default exports

## Options for import-align rule

The import-align rule has support for some additional options:

- `collapseExtraSpace` (Boolean, default: false) - If true, removes any unneeded extra space, collapsing lines to the minimum needed. Useful for correcting alignment after removing a long import.
- `minColumnWidth` (Number, default: 0) - Ensures that the right half of each import doesn't start before the desired minimum column width. If the longest import exceeds this value, the minimum column width will be ignored and the longer value will be used for alignment.

To use these options:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "arca/import-align": [2, {
            "collapseExtraSpace": true,
            "minColumnWidth": 20
        }]
    }
}
```
